# Post-processing
After the pipeline has complete, the scripts in here are used to create any visualisations or summary statistics that are wanted from the simulation.
All scripts in this folder are accessible by the command line, and accept as an argument `-f, --folder` which is the absolute path to the output of the simulation.
