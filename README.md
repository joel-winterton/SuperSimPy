# SuperSimPy
Workflow for simulation of 5million+ genome pandemic that can be used to test phylogenetic methods on large scale epidemics.
The current setup simulates a pandemic between 209 countries, with country codes listed in `population_data/output/census_2013.csv`.
Data for realistic migration and sampling dynamics are obtained through air travel data (2013) and COVID sampling data (2024).

## Setup
Clone the project and navigate inside: 

`git clone https://github.com/joely-w/SuperSimPy.git`

`cd SuperSimPy`

Create and activate a conda environment
```shell
conda create -n simulation_test
conda activate simulation_test
```
Install Python, a C++/C compiler and Snakemake (a workflow management tool):
```shell
conda install python=3.9
conda install -c conda-forge gxx
conda install bioconda::snakemake
```
Then install python requirements and go make a cup of tea â˜•: 
```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running simulation
You can then run the whole simulation using the snakemake workflow:
```shell 
snakemake -s simulate.smk -c1 -F
```
If done on a cluster, you can point the output towards an external directory, and add filesystem latency: 
```shell
snakemake -s simulate.smk -c1 -F --latency-wait 10 --config output_directory='/home/joel/output_data'
```
If you only want to execute unsatisfied tasks (say you've deleted some files), remove the `-F` flag, this will remove the force rerun option and snakemake will only run tasks which need to be updated according to their updated dependencies.
### Migration data
The migration data is pre-generated in this repository, but should you want to create different data,
the process of generating this data is done in the Jupyter notebook files in `/population_data`. 

An important element you may want to change is the `in_country_probability` variable in the migration matrix script (just re-running this script will re-populate the data with changes).
This variable controls the uniform probability that an individual stays in their country per-unit time, so a lower value will cause more migration. 

The notebooks collate several sources together and so work in the order of `census_cleanup -> migration_matrix -> sampling_multipliers`.
This directory also contains a script to relabel locations from their integer ID's to readable location names.

### Changing number of samples 
You can override the default number of samples and iterations by editing it in the `config` flag. For instance, if you want to have 50 samples and 2000 iterations: 
```shell
snakemake -s simulate.smk -c1 -F --config vg_iterations=2000 vg_samples=50  
```
You can also change the number of samples in a simulation through the `config.yml` file, by editing the `vg_samples` property.
If you want lots of samples, you'll also need to increase the number if iterations so that the simulation does not stop before the number of samples have been achieved (using `vg_iterations`).
### Cluster friendly command 
Using the above, an example of a command you might run on a cluster to perform the simulation might be:
```shell
snakemake -s simulate.smk -c1 -F --latency-wait 30 --config output_directory='/home/results' vg_iterations=65000000 vg_samples=1000000
```
## Result 
By default, all resulting files will be placed inside the repository folder in `./data`.
The result of this pipeline is all tied into one file `results.jsonl.gz` which is an annotated tree which contains 
the scaled time, along with the location of each sample, and each internal node. This can be visualised in Taxonium: 
https://taxonium.org/.


## Development setup
Unless you want to develop the libraries used locally, ignore this. 
To develop locally, you'll need the following dependencies install:
1. VGsim https://github.com/joely-w/VGsim [Note: This is a modified VGSim, normal VGSim will not work!]
2. PhastSim https://github.com/NicolaDM/phastSim
3. Snakemake https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html
4. Taxonium `pip install taxoniumtools`
### Configuration
Once everything is installed you'll need to point snakemake towards the correct executables, by editing the fields in the `executables` field of `config.yaml`.
#### phastSim
Change the value of `phastexec` to the absolute path of `bin/phastSim` contained within the installation of phastSim. 
#### VGsim
Change the value of `vgexec` to the absolute path of `VGsim_cmd.py` (located within the cloned repository of VGsim, but once VGsim has been installed `VGsim_cmd.py` can be moved anywhere).
### Pipeline
Snakemake is used to run the workflow, which runs as VGSim -> phastSim -> taxonium.

To run the workflow:
```snakemake -s simulate.smk -c1```
To force the workflow to start from scratch: 
```snakemake -s simulate.smk -c1 -F```
